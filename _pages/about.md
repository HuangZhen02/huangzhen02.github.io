I'm **Zhen Huang ("黄臻" in Chinese)**, a first-year Ph.D. student at Fudan University, under the supervision of [Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/) (primary advisor, affiliated with [GAIR Lab](https://plms.ai/) @ SJTU) and [Xipeng Qiu](https://xpqiu.github.io/) (affiliated with [FudanNLP](https://nlp.fudan.edu.cn/) @ FDU). I received my Bachelor's degree from the [School of Computer Science and Technology at Soochow University](https://scst.suda.edu.cn/), where I spent four wonderful and fantastic years.

- I'm a passionate football enthusiast. I'm a devoted **Chelsea** FC supporter, drawn to the club's legendary spirit—a testament to resilience, determination, and never giving up. Beyond the club itself, I'm an ardent admirer of **José Mourinho**, whose distinctive personality and tactical genius(counter-attacking) have left an indelible mark on football.
